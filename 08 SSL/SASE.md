#### What is SASE?
SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is a cloud-based security model that merges networking and security functions, 
delivering them at the "edge" of the network to support remote work, cloud applications, 
and mobile users by integrating capabilities like zero trust, secure web gateways, and cloud access security brokers.

#### Traditional networks, in contrast, 
rely on a hub-and-spoke architecture, routing all traffic to a central data center for security, 
which creates bottlenecks and security gaps for users outside the physical perimeter, 
leading to higher costs, complexity, and performance issues. 

#### Benefits of SASE
- Enhanced Security: Integrates multiple security functions, like Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), into a single framework, reducing vulnerabilities 
and creating a more robust security posture.

- Improved Performance: Delivers security services from the nearest edge, reducing latency and improving the user experience, 
especially for latency-sensitive applications.

- Greater Scalability & Flexibility: Its cloud-native architecture allows for effortless scaling to meet business growth and 
supports dynamic, remote work environments. (Elasticity of Cloud Resources | Pay-as-you-go model | PoP | reduced Back-Hauling to HQ | location independant | SDWAN)

- Cost Efficiency: Reduces costs by consolidating disparate systems, minimizing the need for additional hardware, and 
offering a more cost-effective, subscription-based model.

- Simplified Management: Provides a centralized, unified management platform for both network and security policies, which reduces operational complexity.

- Supports Remote Work: Securely connects remote and mobile users to enterprise resources, making it ideal for hybrid workforces. 

#### Cons of Traditional Networks 

- Operational Bottlenecks at HQ

- Increased Complexity managing a patchwork of different hardware and software solutions for security.

- High Costs: Involves significant upfront capital investment for hardware, physical infrastructure, and ongoing maintenance costs.

- Unrealistic Timeline - Procurement and Deployment takes much longer then software defined way.

- Security Gaps - Always need to think about budget vs security
