Hi, I’m Ajit Kumar Patel. I bring over 12+ years of experience in enterprise networking, cloud infrastructure, and network virtualization 

— with deep expertise in NSX, HCX, SDN, and hybrid cloud setups across VMware, AWS, and OCI.

Over the last few years, I’ve bridged networking with compute and automation, especially in customer-critical environments. 

I’m now transitioning fully into Cloud Compute to work closer with platform reliability, autoscaling, and infrastructure orchestration.

I see Oracle Cloud as a powerful ecosystem to grow into a full-stack cloud architect, and I’m excited to bring my real-world experience to this journey.
