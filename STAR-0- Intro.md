#### Intro:

Hi, Iâ€™m Ajit Kumar Patel. 

I bring over 12+ years of experience in enterprise networking, cloud infrastructure, and network virtualization 

â€” with deep expertise in NFV SDN, worked on product like Cisco, NSX, HCX, SDN, and hybrid cloud setups across VMware, AWS, and OCI.

Over the last few years, Iâ€™ve bridged networking with compute, enabling seamless infrastructure integration and operations. especially in customer-critical environments. 

Iâ€™m now transitioning fully into Cloud Compute to work closer with platform reliability, autoscaling, and infrastructure orchestration.

I see Oracle Cloud as a powerful ecosystem to grow into a full-stack cloud architect, and Iâ€™m excited to bring my real-world experience toÂ thisÂ journey.



#### NSX-T Integration with vsphere, Log-Insight, Network Insight and troubleshooted VMware cloud and AWS

#### Why Shift to Cloud Compute?

- Networking is no longer isolated â€” compute, network, and storage are tightly integrated

- I have Intrest in automation, performance tuning, and cloud-native architecture

- Compute is where design, performance, and scalability decisions converge

- Want to grow into a Cloud Architect â€“ need stronger exposure to compute

#### Why Oracle

I'm excited to join Oracle as a Senior Cloud Engineer,

because OCIâ€™s architecture is built for high performance, security, and enterprise-grade workloads 

â€” which aligns perfectly with my 12+ years of experience in cloud networking, virtualization, and secure infrastructure. 

Iâ€™ve worked across platforms like VMware, AWS, and NSX, and 

I see Oracle as the right place to apply that expertise while growing with a team thatâ€™s solving global-scale cloud challenges.

#### ðŸ“ˆ Career Goal

To become a *Cloud Infrastructure Architect* with a strong grasp on hybrid/multi-cloud, performance engineering, and platform design. Oracle is the best place to make that transition.
