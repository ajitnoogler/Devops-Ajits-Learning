### Monitoring

### üîç Prometheus ‚Äì Monitoring & Alerting Tool (Metric collection & alerting)

    - Purpose: Collects and stores metrics (like CPU usage, memory, disk, HTTP requests).

    - Data model: Time-series data with labels (e.g., cpu_usage{instance="server1"})

    Function:

       - Scrapes metrics from targets (like Node Exporter, cAdvisor, etc.)

       - Stores them in its time-series database

       -  Evaluates alert rules and sends alerts (via Alertmanager)

‚úÖ Think of Prometheus as the backend data collector.
