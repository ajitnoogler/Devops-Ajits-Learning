üîÅ What It Shows:

    Packets are looping between Router B and Router C.

    There's likely a misconfigured static route or a dynamic routing protocol issue.

    The destination is never reached (no 198.51.100.1).

---

üß† Tip for DevOps/Network Engineers:

    Use traceroute or mtr to visualize loops.

    Check route tables and BGP/OSPF configurations at the looping routers.

    Use debug ip routing, show ip route, or show ip cef on Cisco-like devices.
