üîÅ Scenario: Misconfigured Static Routes or Routing Protocols

    Router B thinks the best route to 198.51.100.1 is via Router C.

    Router C thinks the best route to 198.51.100.1 is via Router B.

    So when Router B receives the packet, it forwards it to C.

    Router C receives it and sends it back to B.

    The packet loops infinitely between them.
---
üîÅ Why This Causes a Routing Loop

    Both routers have two static routes each pointing back to the other for 198.51.100.0/24.

    If the destination 198.51.100.1 is not available, packets loop:

        B ‚ûù C via Link 1

        C ‚ûù B via Link 2

        and repeat...

---
‚úÖ To Stop the Loop add Blackhole Route to Null0

    Use ip route 198.51.100.0 255.255.255.0 null0 on Router C to blackhole.
---

```text
traceroute to 198.51.100.1, 30 hops max
 1  10.0.0.1             (Router A)
 2  192.0.2.1            (Router B)

 4  192.0.2.1            (Router B)

 9  203.0.113.1          (Router C)
10  192.0.2.1            (Router B)
11  203.0.113.1          (Router C)
12  192.0.2.1            (Router B)
13  203.0.113.1          (Router C)
14  192.0.2.1            (Router B)
15  203.0.113.1          (Router C)
```

---

üîÅ What It Shows:

    Packets are looping between Router B and Router C.

    There's likely a misconfigured static route or a dynamic routing protocol issue.

    The destination is never reached (no 198.51.100.1).

---

üß† Tip for DevOps/Network Engineers:

    Use traceroute or mtr to visualize loops.

    Check route tables and BGP/OSPF configurations at the looping routers.

    Use debug ip routing, show ip route, or show ip cef on Cisco-like devices.

Here‚Äôs a **sample routing config** for **Router B and Router C** (from the previous diagram with multiple links between them) to simulate a **routing loop** in a lab or GNS3 environment.

We‚Äôll use **static routes** for simplicity and simulate **redundant paths with two interfaces** between Router B and Router C.

### üîÅ Why This Causes a Routing Loop

* Both routers have **two static routes each** pointing **back to the other** for `198.51.100.0/24`.
* If the destination `198.51.100.1` is **not available**, packets loop:

  * B ‚ûù C via Link 1
  * C ‚ûù B via Link 2
  * and repeat...

---

### ‚úÖ To Stop the Loop

* Use `ip route 198.51.100.0 255.255.255.0 null0` on Router C to blackhole.
* Or, implement **dynamic routing protocols** with loop prevention (e.g., OSPF with proper cost metrics or BGP with AS\_PATH checks).
* Or, use **route filtering / administrative distance**.
