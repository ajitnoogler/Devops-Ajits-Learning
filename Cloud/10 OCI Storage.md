## ☁️ Cloud Storage Types (Beginner-Friendly)

Cloud storage is how cloud providers (like AWS or OCI) let you **store data remotely**, with different types based on use case:

### 1. **Object Storage**

* Stores **files (objects)** with metadata and unique identifiers.
* Great for **backups, media, logs, and web content**.
* Scales easily, and access is over **HTTP(S)** using REST APIs.

> 🧰 Use case: Storing images, backups, logs, or static website files.

---

### 2. **Block Storage**

* Works like a **virtual hard drive** (volume).
* You attach it to **VMs** (Compute Instances) and install a filesystem.
* High-performance I/O — used for **databases or applications**.

> 🧰 Use case: Running a database like MySQL or storing OS files for a VM.

---

### 3. **File Storage**

* Provides **shared file systems** (like NFS or SMB).
* Accessible by multiple VMs at the same time.
* Used when apps require **shared access to files**.

> 🧰 Use case: File shares for apps or enterprise tools that need shared data.

## 📊 OCI vs AWS Storage Types

| **Storage Type**       | **OCI** (Oracle Cloud)                        | **AWS** (Amazon Web Services)                     | **Purpose / Use Case**                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Object Storage**     | Object Storage                                | S3 (Simple Storage Service)                       | Store images, logs, backups, large files   |
| **Block Storage**      | Block Volumes (Basic, Balanced, Higher Perf)  | EBS (Elastic Block Store)                         | Boot volumes, app data, databases          |
| **File Storage**       | File Storage (NFSv3)                          | EFS (Elastic File System - NFS), FSx (Windows FS) | Shared storage between compute nodes       |
| **Archive Storage**    | Archive Storage (low-cost, long-term)         | S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Deep Archive               | Cold storage, compliance archives          |
| **Local/NVMe Storage** | Local NVMe (Ephemeral)                        | Instance Store                                    | Ultra-fast temporary storage for VMs       |
| **Object Lifecycle**   | Tiering: Standard, Infrequent Access, Archive | S3 Storage Classes (Standard, IA, Glacier)        | Manage cost based on data access frequency |

## 🔑 Key Differences: OCI vs AWS

| Feature                  | OCI                                   | AWS                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object Storage Classes   | Standard, Archive (automatic tiering) | Standard, IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive |
| File Storage Protocol    | NFSv3                                 | NFS (EFS), SMB (FSx)                                     |
| Performance Tiers        | Block volume has 3 performance tiers  | EBS volumes come in gp2, gp3, io1, st1, sc1              |
| Archive Automation       | Auto-tiering with rules               | Lifecycle policies on S3                                 |
| Local SSD Option         | NVMe on Dense IO Shapes               | Instance Store only on specific types                    |
| Cross-region Replication | Supported (Object, Block)             | Supported (S3, EBS snapshots, etc.)                      |

## ✅ Summary

* **Object Storage** is ideal for **unstructured data**, backups, and static websites.
* **Block Storage** is like a **disk drive for your VM**, good for OS, DBs.
* **File Storage** is used when multiple VMs need to **share the same filesystem**.
* **Archive Storage** is cold storage — **very cheap, very slow**.

### ➕ OCI vs AWS:

* **OCI is simpler** with fewer tiers, but powerful performance tiers.
* **AWS offers more options**, integrations, and automation features for enterprises.
