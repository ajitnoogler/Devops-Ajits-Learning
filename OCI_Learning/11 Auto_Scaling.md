### Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that automatically adjusts the resources allocated to an application or service based on demand. It dynamically scales resources up or down to match performance needs, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency. 

### Horizontal Scaling -  Add more instances (servers or nodes) to distribute the load.

   - Auto Scaling Group with 3 EC2 web servers behind an ALB
     
   - Amazon RDS Aurora with read replicas

### Vertical Scaling -  Increase the resources (CPU, RAM, IOPS) of a single instance or upgrade instance type

   - Resize EC2 instance from t3.small to c6i.4xlarge for compute-heavy task

   - RDS PostgreSQL upgraded from db.t3.medium to db.r6i.4xlarge

### Autoscaler Event Triggers:
   - Metric based -> Performance metrics like CPU,  Memory
   - Schedule based -> Its trigger at Admin defined scheduled i.e Amazon or Flipkart Big Billion Day Sale | Black Friday Sale etc.

### 🔍 Summary

    - Horizontal scaling is better for high availability, distributed workloads, and cloud-native applications.

    - Vertical scaling is easier to implement but limited and often involves downtime.

### 📊 Comparison: Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling in AWS

| Feature                 | **Horizontal Scaling** (Scale Out/In)                        | **Vertical Scaling** (Scale Up/Down)                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | Add more instances/nodes to the system                       | Increase the size (CPU, RAM, etc.) of a single instance          |
| **How it works in AWS** | Add more EC2 instances behind a Load Balancer (Auto Scaling) | Change EC2 instance type to a more powerful one (e.g., t3 → m6i) |
| **Example**             | Add 3 EC2 web servers behind an ALB                          | Upgrade EC2 from `t3.medium` → `c7i.2xlarge`                     |
| **Scalability**         | High, near-infinite (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling Groups)          | Limited by the max size of a single instance                     |
| **Fault tolerance**     | High — if one instance fails, others take over               | Low — if one instance fails, whole service might go down         |
| **Cost**                | Can be cheaper for distributed loads                         | May become expensive quickly at higher sizes                     |
| **Performance gain**    | Improves throughput via parallelism                          | Improves performance on single-threaded workloads                |
| **Use Cases**           | Web servers, stateless microservices, distributed databases  | Single-threaded DBs, legacy apps, vertical-licensed software     |
| **AWS Services**        | EC2 Auto Scaling, ECS/Fargate, Lambda, RDS Aurora Cluster    | EC2 instance resizing, RDS instance class upgrade                |
| **Scaling Speed**       | Usually slower (provision time + warm-up)                    | Faster (restart instance with higher spec)                       |
| **Maintenance**         | Requires orchestration/load balancing (e.g., ALB/NLB)        | Simpler, but may require downtime for reboot                     |
