
# OCI Load Balancing:
- It loadbalance traffic between multiple Compute Instances.
- It reduces slowness and Downtime to the backend application.

# When to use ALB | NLB | GwLB
ALB - Application LB: when you want to perform loadbalancing on Layer 7 application layer 
i.e HTTP | HTTPS | SSL-TLS Offloading-Termination | WAF Integration | Pathbased-URL Based Routing | Host-Based-Routing based on Host Header in HTTP Request

NLB - Network LB: When you want to perform loadbalancing on Layer 4 TCP and UDP traffic and requirement is extremely low latency. 
i.e To Preserve SRC-IP | TLS Termination on NGFW 

GwLb - Not available in OCI, workaround with VCN routing + NGFW.

# Path Based Routing:
https://example.com/api/       →  Target Group A (API servers)
https://example.com/images/    →  Target Group B (Image servers)
https://example.com/login      →  Target Group C (Auth service)

Use Case: Microservices architecture | Single domain with multiple apps (e.g., /admin, /user, /blog) | API Gateway-like use case

#  Host-Based Routing (Hostname-based)
https://api.example.com     →  Target Group A (API servers)
https://admin.example.com   →  Target Group B (Admin dashboard)
https://www.example.com     →  Target Group C (Main website)

Use Case: Hosting multiple websites on a single ALB | Multi-tenant environments (SaaS) | Blue/Green deployments on different subdomains

Assume you have Application which is new and have not much traffic and can be handled by a Single Instance.
Your Application became popular and lot of traffic started hitting the Single Instance causing slowness and Downtime.
Here, you can deploy a Load Balancer and multiple backend server to serve user request.
User traffic will hit the loadbalancer URL and then LB will be responsible to distribute load to backend server.


# Application Loadbalancer: 
It provides Reverse Proxy solution that hides the IP of the client from Backend App Server
It is capable of performing advance Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPA), Layer 4 TCP load-balancing and SSL Offloading
Best For - Websites, Mobile-Apps, SSL Termination, and advance HTTP Handling.

# Network Loadbalancer: 
It provides a pass-through non-proxy-solution that is capable of preserving the Client header (Src-IP and Dst-IP).
Its is Built for Speed, Optimized for long running connection.
Best For - VoIP, IoT, and Trading PLatforms.

# What is SSL Offloading?
SSL Offloading is the process of terminating SSL/TLS encryption at a load balancer or proxy, instead of letting the backend servers handle encryption/decryption.
# Where SSL Offloading is Used:
At Load Balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, OCI Load Balancer, NGINX, F5, etc.)
Often used in reverse proxy or frontend gateway roles.

# 🧠 Purpose:
Reduce CPU load on backend servers (no SSL compute cost).
Centralize certificate management (upload SSL cert only to LB).
Enable Layer 7 features (host/path-based routing, WAF inspection).

# Flow Example:
Client ──HTTPS──▶ Load Balancer (SSL Offload)
                └──HTTP──▶ Backend Server (plaintext)

# 🔬 Key Differences: SSL Offloading vs SSL Decryption

| Feature                  | **SSL Offloading**                | **SSL Decryption (Palo Alto)**                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Goal**         | Performance & L7 routing          | Security inspection                                      |
| **Where Used**           | Load balancer / proxy             | Firewall (NGFW)                                          |
| **Terminates SSL?**      | Yes                               | Yes, temporarily for inspection                          |
| **Re-encrypts traffic?** | Optional (Passthrough or offload) | Yes (by default, to preserve secure session)             |
| **Target Traffic**       | Inbound app traffic               | Inbound or outbound encrypted traffic                    |
| **End user visibility**  | Transparent                       | May require installing **forward trust cert** on clients |
| **Typical Products**     | ALB, NGINX, OCI LB, F5            | Palo Alto NGFW, Fortinet, Checkpoint                     |
