## üîÑ Step-by-Step Packet Flow in OCI (Web App Access from Internet)

### 1. **User Sends HTTP/HTTPS Request**

* The user from the internet types `https://mywebapp.example.com`.
* DNS resolves the domain to the **Public IP** or **Public Load Balancer IP**.

---

### 2. **Traffic Hits OCI Public Load Balancer (Optional)**

* If you're using an **OCI Load Balancer (LB)** (for scalability/high availability):

  * **OCI LB (Public IP)** receives the request.
  * **SSL Termination/Offloading** can occur here.
  * Load Balancer checks:

    * Security List or NSG rules
    * Listener configuration
    * Backend set health
  * Forwarded to backend VM/Container in a **private subnet**.

---

### 3. **If Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) in Path (Optional, for Firewalls)**

* Packet routed to **GWLB** ‚Üí Sends mirrored or inline traffic to:

  * **3rd-party NGFW (Palo Alto, Fortinet, etc.)** in **Inspection Subnet**.
* Firewall performs:

  * **L7 inspection**
  * **Decryption** (if applicable)
  * **Policy enforcement** (e.g., PCI, WAF, etc.)
* If allowed, packet forwarded back to GWLB, then to web tier.

---

### 4. **Packet Reaches Web Server in Private Subnet**

* VM instance or Kubernetes pod running the web app receives the packet.
* Web server processes the request (e.g., Apache/Nginx/Tomcat).
* If required, calls App or DB tier over **Private Subnet Routing**.

---

### 5. **Routing and Security Checks in OCI**

* Each hop is subject to:

  * **Route Table Evaluation** (at Subnet or VNIC level)
  * **Security Lists** or **Network Security Group (NSG)** Rules
  * **Stateful inspection** (OCI is stateful by default)

---

### 6. **Web Server Sends HTTP Response**

* Web app sends back HTML/JSON content or redirect.
* Packet flows in **reverse path**, following the stateful connection:

  * Web App ‚Üí NGFW (if inline) ‚Üí OCI LB ‚Üí Internet

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Services That Might Be in the Path

| Service                       | Function                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OCI WAF**                   | Filters malicious web traffic (can sit in front of LB or DNS) |
| **Service Gateway**           | Used if app connects to OCI Object Storage or other services  |
| **NAT Gateway**               | For outbound-only access from private subnet                  |
| **Internet Gateway**          | Allows inbound/outbound traffic from public subnets           |
| **DNS (OCI DNS / 3rd-party)** | Resolves domain to IP                                         |

Let me know if you want the **same flow with specific IPs/subnets**, **packet capture examples**, or **diagrams in GNS3/Draw\.io** format.
