# üîÑ ITIL: Problem Management vs Incident Management

Understanding the difference between **Incident Management** and **Problem Management** is essential for maintaining high service availability and long-term stability in IT operations.

---

## üö® What is Incident Management?

**Goal:**  
Restore **normal service operations as quickly as possible** and minimize business impact.

**Definition:**  
An **incident** is an unplanned interruption or degradation in the quality of an IT service.

**Examples:**
- A website is down
- A user can't access email
- Network slowness or printer not working

#### Key Activities:
- Incident detection and logging
- Initial diagnosis and categorization
- Escalation (if needed)
- Resolution and recovery
- Communication with users

**Focus:** **Fix fast** ‚Äì often with a workaround

**Owner:** **Incident Manager**

#### üß† What is Problem Management?

**Goal:**  
Identify and eliminate the **root cause** of incidents and prevent recurrence.

**Definition:**  
A **problem** is the **underlying cause** of one or more incidents.

**Examples:**
- A failing disk causes repeated outages
- A misconfigured firewall rule causes intermittent network drops
- A memory leak in an application causes frequent crashes

### Key Activities:
- Problem detection (from recurring incidents, trend analysis)
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
- Workaround identification
- Change Request (if fix requires)
- Knowledge base documentation

**Focus:** **Fix forever** ‚Äì resolve root cause

**Owner:** **Problem Manager**

#### üîÅ Comparison Table: Incident vs Problem Management

| Aspect                 | Incident Management                       | Problem Management                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Objective**          | Restore service ASAP                       | Identify and eliminate root cause            |
| **Trigger**            | User reports an issue                      | Triggered by multiple/repeated incidents     |
| **Time Sensitivity**   | High ‚Äì immediate business impact           | Medium/Low ‚Äì long-term focus                 |
| **Approach**           | Reactive (resolve symptoms)                | Proactive & reactive (resolve root causes)   |
| **Output**             | Incident ticket resolution                 | Root cause analysis, known error record      |
| **Tools Used**         | ITSM portal, incident queues               | RCA tools, error logs, trend analytics       |
| **Responsible Role**   | Incident Manager / Support teams           | Problem Manager / Engineering                |
| **Resolution Type**    | Workaround or quick fix                    | Permanent fix or change implementation       |

#### üîÑ Real-world Example

#### Incident:
> Users can't log in to the web portal ‚Äì IT support restarts the service. Problem temporarily solved.

#### Problem:
> Logs show that the issue recurs every Monday after patching. RCA finds a memory leak. Engineering team patches the application.

| **Trigger**          | User reports, alerts, monitoring tools       | Recurring incidents, major incident analysis     |
| **Goal**             | Minimize **downtime and impact**             | Prevent future incidents / reduce recurrence     |
| **Time Sensitivity** | **High priority** ‚Äì resolved ASAP            | Less time-sensitive ‚Äì root cause analysis driven |
| **Output**           | Resolved incident or workaround implemented  | Root Cause Analysis (RCA), known error database  |
| **Example**          | Restarting a failed VM to restore access     | Investigating why the VM crashes every week      |
| **Handled by**       | L1/L2 support teams                          | L3 teams, engineering, or problem managers       |

#### üß† Key Differences

Incident Management = Firefighting

    ‚ÄúGet it working now.‚Äù

Problem Management = Fire prevention

    ‚ÄúWhy did this happen and how do we stop it from happening again?‚Äù
