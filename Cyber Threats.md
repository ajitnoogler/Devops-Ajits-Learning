### 🎯 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Groups and Attacks

#### 🔍 What is APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)?

APT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat — a type of stealthy, continuous cyberattack typically sponsored by nation-states or highly organized criminal groups. 

These attackers target specific entities, often for espionage, intellectual property theft, sabotage, or long-term surveillance.

#### 🧠 Key Characteristics of APT

| 🧩 Attribute   | 📌 Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Advanced**   | Uses sophisticated tools (e.g., zero-days, custom malware) and multi-stage attack chains (initial access, persistence, exfiltration). |
| **Persistent** | Maintains long-term access to systems without detection; attacker goal is not quick theft, but deep surveillance.                     |
| **Threat**     | Indicates a coordinated, well-funded adversary — often with political, military, or economic motivations.                             |

#### 🎯 APT Goals:

Espionage: Stealing sensitive government, military, or corporate data

Sabotage: Disrupting infrastructure (e.g., power grid, oil refineries)

Data Theft: Intellectual property, source code, research data

Surveillance: Tracking targets silently for months or years

Influence: Manipulating public opinion (e.g., election interference)
