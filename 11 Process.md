#### ‚úÖ 1. What is Severity?

Severity (or "Sev") defines the impact level of a technical issue on the customer's business or services. 
It's crucial during triage because it determines how fast and how seriously the cloud provider responds.

#### üìå Best Practices for Setting Severity

- Use high severity only for real outages (e.g., app down, VPN broken, LB not routing).

- Clearly state business impact in ticket description.

- Update severity if the issue is resolved or mitigated.

- Include logs, resource IDs, timestamps to help engineers respond faster.
