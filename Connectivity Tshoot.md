#### Ticket:
#### Problem Statement : user on the onprem unable to reach an oci instance. 

#### Step by Step to troubleshoot the issue with packet flow

#### ‚úÖ 1. Clarify Scope and Context:

Collect Initial Info:

| Info              | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Source            | On-prem system IP (e.g., `10.10.10.50`)          |
| Destination       | OCI Instance Private/Public IP                   |
| Protocol          | ICMP / TCP / UDP (e.g., ping/SSH/HTTPS)          |
| Time of issue     | Ongoing or intermittent                          |
| Connectivity type | Site-to-Site VPN / FastConnect / Public Internet |
| Instance OS       | Linux/Windows, firewall status                   |

---
#### 2. Confirm Basic Reachability (OSI Layer 3):

From On-Prem: ping <OCI_IP> && traceroute <OCI_IP>

Expected: Ping/traceroute should complete or show where the packet is dropping.

---

#### üîç 3. Validate Routing
On-Prem Router / Firewall:

  -  Confirm that the destination OCI subnet is part of the route table.

  -  Verify NAT policies are not blocking or modifying the packet incorrectly.

In OCI:

  -  Go to VCN > Route Table

       - Verify route to on-prem subnet via DRG or Internet Gateway (based on connection type).

       - Example route:

          -  Destination: 10.10.10.0/24

          -  Target: DRG

---

#### üîê 4. Check Network Security Rules (Layer 4 Filtering)

On OCI:
a. Security List (Stateless/Stateful)

   - Check Ingress & Egress rules of the OCI subnet.

   - For ICMP/SSH, allow the specific protocol from on-prem subnet.

b. Network Security Groups (NSGs)

   - Check if the instance is in an NSG.

   - Ensure rules in the NSG match the traffic from on-prem.

Rule Sample (for SSH): 
 
- Ingress: Source = 10.10.10.0/24, Protocol = TCP, Port = 22

- Egress: Destination = 10.10.10.0/24, Protocol = ALL or TCP

---

#### üß± 5. Verify OCI Instance Settings

a. VNIC Configuration:

  -  Ensure correct subnet and NSG/Security List attached.

  -  Check private/public IP.

b. OS-Level Firewall:

  -  Linux: iptables -L / firewalld

  -  Windows: netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all

c. Check Listening Services:

  - sudo netstat -tulnp | grep <port>

d. Check Logs:

  -  /var/log/messages, /var/log/secure (for SSH)

  -  /var/log/syslog or application logs

---

#### üîó 6. VPN / FastConnect / DRG Validation
a. Check Tunnel Status

-    On VPN: OCI Console > Site-to-Site VPN > Tunnel status (UP/DOWN)

-    On Prem: Check device logs (e.g., Cisco/Juniper)

b. Check DRG Attachments

-    VCN is attached to DRG.

-    DRG route table has on-prem and OCI subnet routes.

---

#### üß™ 7. Use Test Tools (TCP/UDP/ICMP)

a. From On-Prem: 

- nc -zv <oci_ip> 22        # Test TCP port

- telnet <oci_ip> 22        # Alt for TCP test

b. From OCI to On-Prem:

ping <onprem_ip>

---

#### üß∞ 8. Packet Capture (Advanced)

a. OCI Instance:

sudo tcpdump -i any host <onprem_ip> and port 22

b. On-Prem Gateway/Firewall:

    Check logs for dropped packets, session timeouts.

#### üõ†Ô∏è 9. Possible Root Causes

| Category | Issue                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Routing  | Missing route in OCI or on-prem                          |
| Firewall | Blocked by NSG, security list, or OS firewall            |
| VPN      | Tunnel down, phase-2 selector mismatch                   |
| NAT      | NAT rule modifying packet source/destination incorrectly |
| Subnet   | Incorrect subnet or IP assignment in OCI                 |
| Port     | Target service not running or listening                  |

---
#### üì¶ 10. Fix and Retest

- Add missing route or NSG rule.

- Restart service or firewall on instance.

- Ensure VPN tunnel is up and phase 2 selectors match both sides.

- Use packet captures to confirm flow after change.

#### üß∞ Additional Checks When OCI Load Balancer is Involved

| **Check**                                | **Description**                                                                                    | **Commands / Console Path**               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **1. Load Balancer Type**                | Determine if it's **Public** or **Private** LB. Affects access path.                               | OCI Console > Networking > Load Balancer  |
| **2. Listener Configuration**            | Ensure correct **port**, **protocol**, and **hostname** in listener settings.                      | OCI Console > Load Balancer > Listener    |
| **3. Backend Set Health**                | Check if backends (OCI instances) show as **`Healthy`**. Unhealthy backends don‚Äôt receive traffic. | OCI Console > Load Balancer > Backend Set |
| **4. Backend Port Reachability**         | Verify the **backend port** (e.g., 80, 443, 8080) is open and service is running on instance.      | `curl localhost:<port>` on instance       |
| **5. Security List / NSG for LB Subnet** | Allow traffic **from on-prem** to the **LB subnet**, and **from LB to backends**.                  | Security List or NSG rules                |
| **6. LB Subnet Routing**                 | Ensure LB subnet has route to backend subnet and vice versa.                                       | VCN Route Tables                          |
| **7. Load Balancer Logging**             | Enable and check **Access Logs** or **Error Logs** to debug traffic issues.                        | OCI Console > Load Balancer > Logging     |
| **8. SSL/TLS Termination**               | If SSL termination is enabled on LB, ensure correct certs and backend protocol.                    | Listener > SSL Certs                      |
| **9. Sticky Sessions (if enabled)**      | Ensure LB cookie or source-IP persistence is not misrouting traffic.                               | Backend Set > Session Persistence         |
| **10. DNS Resolution**                   | If accessing via LB hostname, verify DNS resolves to LB's **IP address**.                          | `nslookup <hostname>`                     |
| **11. Cross-VCN or DRG Flow**            | If LB and backend are in different VCNs or regions, verify DRG/Peering path.                       | VCN > DRG Attachments & Routes            |

#### üìå Example Scenario:

A user on-prem accesses https://app.company.com (OCI Public LB DNS). The LB forwards to a backend instance on port 8080.
You should:

   - Ensure LB listener is on port 443

   - Backend set uses port 8080

   - NSGs allow LB to backend traffic

   - Backend instance is healthy

   -  SSL is properly configured

---

#### üåê Public vs Private Load Balancer in OCI:

- The type of OCI Load Balancer (Public vs Private) significantly affects the access path, DNS resolution, routing, and security.

| **Aspect**                | **Public Load Balancer**                                         | **Private Load Balancer**                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IP Address**            | Has a **Public IP**                                              | Has a **Private IP (VCN subnet)**                                              |
| **Access Scope**          | Accessible over the **Internet**                                 | Accessible **only within VCN / via VPN / FastConnect / VCN Peering**           |
| **DNS Name**              | FQDN resolves to public IP                                       | FQDN resolves to private IP                                                    |
| **Routing Requirements**  | No special route needed for client to reach LB from Internet     | Requires on-prem to have route to LB subnet via **DRG/VPN/FastConnect**        |
| **Security Requirements** | Security List / NSG must allow **Internet Ingress** to LB subnet | Security List / NSG must allow **on-prem subnet** or **peered VCNs** to access |
| **Typical Use Case**      | Websites, apps, or APIs exposed to the public                    | Internal apps, APIs, microservices, or hybrid use cases                        |
| **Health Checks**         | From LB to backend instances over private IPs                    | Same (but ensure backend subnets are reachable from LB subnet)                 |
| **Client Path**           | `User ‚Üí Internet ‚Üí Public LB ‚Üí Backend`                          | `User ‚Üí VPN/FastConnect ‚Üí Private LB ‚Üí Backend`                                |
| **Firewall/NAT Impacts**  | Ensure public LB IP not blocked by on-prem firewall              | Ensure NAT is not rewriting source IP unexpectedly                             |
| **Logging Consideration** | Easier to correlate with public IP logs                          | May require inspection of private IP logs for on-prem clients                  |
| **Failover Impact**       | Affected by Internet Gateway and public IP routing               | Affected by DRG/FastConnect/VPN tunnel stability                               |
