# This code reads server addresses from a file called servers.txt, with each server on a separate line. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

# with open('servers.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:
# Opens the file servers.txt for reading, using UTF-8 encoding. The with statement ensures the file is properly closed after reading.

# servers = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]
# This is a list comprehension that:

# Reads each line from the file.
# Removes leading/trailing whitespace with strip().
# Ignores empty lines (if line.strip()).
# Collects all non-empty, stripped lines into the servers list.
# Result:
# servers will be a list of all server hostnames/IPs from the file, ready for use in your script.
