#### 🔐 What is a WAF (Web Application Firewall)?

A **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** is a **security solution** that **monitors, filters, and blocks HTTP/HTTPS traffic** to and from a web application. It helps protect web applications from **common attacks** such as:

* 🩸 **SQL Injection**
* 🖼️ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
* 🔗 **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
* 📂 **File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)**
* 🚪 **Directory Traversal**
* ⚙️ **Security Misconfigurations**
* 🔓 **Authentication bypasses, session hijacking, etc.**

### 🔐 How WAF Decrypts SSL/TLS to Inspect HTTP Data

When **HTTPS traffic** is used, the **WAF cannot inspect the application-layer (Layer 7) data** unless it first decrypts the encrypted SSL/TLS traffic. This process is called **SSL/TLS Termination** or **SSL Offloading**.

---

## 🧪 Process: SSL Decryption by WAF (a.k.a. SSL Offloading)

```plaintext
[Client]  🔒 HTTPS
   |
   | 1. Encrypted Request
   v
[WAF] 🔓  ➜ Decrypts using Server's SSL Certificate
   |
   | 2. Inspects Plain HTTP (headers, URI, body, cookies, etc.)
   |
   | 3. Re-encrypts (optional)
   v
[Web Server] 🔒 HTTPS or 🔓 HTTP (depending on config)
```

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation

| Step                          | Action                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. SSL Handshake**          | The WAF presents the **SSL certificate** of the server to the client (either same as the backend server or a copied one).                                            |
| **2. Decryption**             | Once handshake succeeds, WAF decrypts the request and sees **raw HTTP content** (URL, body, cookies, etc.).                                                          |
| **3. Inspection**             | WAF applies its **security rules** (e.g., detect SQLi, XSS, LFI).                                                                                                    |
| **4. Optional Re-encryption** | WAF **forwards traffic** to backend server either via: <br> 🔹 HTTP (if SSL is terminated at WAF) <br> 🔹 HTTPS (if WAF re-encrypts traffic using a different cert). |

### ⚙️ WAF SSL Termination Deployment Modes

| Mode                       | Description                             | Pros                  | Cons                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **SSL Termination at WAF** | WAF decrypts and sends HTTP to backend  | Deep inspection       | Backend exposed in clear    |
| **SSL Bridging**           | WAF decrypts, inspects, and re-encrypts | End-to-end encryption | More resource-intensive     |
| **SSL Pass-through**       | WAF can't inspect payload               | Fastest               | No HTTP inspection possible |

Great! Below are **step-by-step setup guides** for enabling **SSL decryption/inspection** on three popular WAF platforms: **FortiWeb**, **F5 BIG-IP WAF**, and **Cloudflare**.

---

## 🔐 1. FortiWeb WAF – SSL Inspection (Offloading/Bridging)

### 📦 What You Need:

* FortiWeb license
* SSL certificate + private key of your web app

### 🛠️ Steps (GUI):

1. **Upload SSL Certificate:**

   * Go to: `System` → `Certificates` → `Local`
   * Click **Create** → **Upload** certificate
   * Upload both `.crt` and `.key` files

2. **Create a Server Pool:**

   * Go to: `Server Objects` → `Server Pool`
   * Add backend servers (IP and port)

3. **Create HTTPS Service:**

   * Go to: `Server Policy` → `Virtual Servers`
   * Add new HTTPS virtual server:

     * Select IP, port `443`, and interface
     * Assign uploaded certificate

4. **Create a Server Policy:**

   * Go to: `Server Policy`
   * Add new policy:

     * Select virtual server (step 3)
     * Enable **SSL Offloading**
     * Enable **HTTPS to HTTP** or **Re-encrypt to HTTPS** based on your backend
     * Attach Web Protection Profile (XSS, SQLi, etc.)

5. **Enable Policy**

   * Enable and test with your browser using HTTPS.

## 🔐 2. F5 BIG-IP Advanced WAF – SSL Offloading/Bridging

### 📦 What You Need:

* SSL cert/key installed on BIG-IP
* Web app pool backend

### 🛠️ Steps (GUI or TMSH CLI):

1. **Create SSL Profile:**

#### Client SSL Profile (for decrypting from client):

```bash
tmsh create ltm profile client-ssl ssl_client cert your_cert.crt key your_key.key
```

#### (Optional) Server SSL Profile (for re-encrypting to backend):

```bash
tmsh create ltm profile server-ssl ssl_server defaults-from serverssl
```

2. **Configure Virtual Server:**

```bash
tmsh create ltm virtual https_vs destination 10.0.0.10:443 \
ip-protocol tcp profiles add { http ssl_client } \
pool web_pool
```

> For SSL bridging, also add `ssl_server` to the profiles list.

3. **Attach WAF Policy:**

```bash
tmsh modify ltm virtual https_vs waf-policy /Common/block_sql_xss_policy
```

4. **Apply and Test.**

---

## 🔐 3. Cloudflare WAF – Full SSL Inspection (Strict Mode)

### 📦 What You Need:

* Cloudflare account (Free or Paid)
* DNS managed by Cloudflare
* Web server with valid SSL certificate

### 🛠️ Steps:

1. **Set SSL/TLS Mode:**

   * Go to: `SSL/TLS` → Set to **Full (Strict)**
   * Ensures both sides (Cloudflare ↔ origin) are HTTPS

2. **Upload SSL Cert (Optional - Enterprise Only):**

   * You can upload your own cert for end-to-end control
   * For Pro/Business/Free tiers, use Origin Certificates

3. **Enable WAF Rules:**

   * Go to: `Security` → `WAF`
   * Enable **Managed Rulesets** like OWASP, Cloudflare Managed, Bot Fight Mode

4. **Page Rules (Optional):**

   * Configure advanced redirect rules, caching or strict enforcement

#### WAF Deployment Types with a clear explanation of each method:

---

#### 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF) Deployment Types

| Deployment Type                         | 🔍 Description                                                                 | ✅ Pros                                         | ⚠️ Cons                                         | 🔧 Use Case                           |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ **Reverse Proxy (Inline)**         | WAF sits between client and web server, intercepting and inspecting all traffic. | Full inspection, easy control, hides origin IP | Latency, single point of failure               | Most secure and popular deployment    |
| 2️⃣ **Transparent Proxy / Layer 2 Bridge** | WAF operates like a switch; no DNS change needed.                              | No network reconfiguration, inline protection  | Difficult to troubleshoot, complex routing     | Drop-in for legacy networks           |
| 3️⃣ **Out-of-Path (SPAN/TAP mode)**    | WAF listens passively; cannot block, only monitor/log.                         | No latency, no downtime, safe for test         | No real-time protection                        | Learning mode, detection-only stage   |
| 4️⃣ **Reverse Proxy with SSL Offloading** | WAF handles SSL/TLS decryption, inspects HTTP, re-encrypts (optional).        | Enables L7 inspection, hides server cert       | Requires private keys and cert management      | API protection, threat inspection     |
| 5️⃣ **Cloud-based WAF (CDN-integrated)** | DNS is pointed to cloud WAF (like Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS WAF).               | Global edge, fast setup, DDoS protection       | DNS hijack risk, less granular control         | Scalable SaaS apps, global web apps   |
| 6️⃣ **Host-based WAF (Agent inside App)** | Runs on same server as app (ModSecurity for Apache/Nginx).                    | App-specific rules, fast local response        | Consumes server resources, hard to scale       | Dev/test environment, small deployments|
| 7️⃣ **Inline Load Balancer/WAF Hybrid** | WAF is integrated with a load balancer (e.g., F5, FortiWeb with LB features).  | Load distribution + protection                 | Expensive, complex configuration               | Enterprises, high availability apps   |
| 8️⃣ **Container-native WAF / Sidecar** | Runs as a container alongside the app in Kubernetes or Docker                  | DevSecOps friendly, CI/CD integrated           | Limited performance, new tech stack required   | Cloud-native microservices/API apps   |

---

#### 📌 Which Deployment Type Should You Choose?

| Scenario                                      | Recommended WAF Deployment            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| You want **maximum control and security**     | Reverse Proxy with SSL Offloading     |
| You have **legacy infra**, can't change DNS   | Transparent Bridge                    |
| You’re in a **DevSecOps** containerized stack | Sidecar WAF / Host-based              |
| You need **fast, global protection**          | Cloud-based WAF (Cloudflare, AWS WAF) |
| You want to **monitor before blocking**       | Out-of-Path (TAP/SPAN Mode)           |

#### 🔧 SSL Troubleshooting Flow for Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)

| 🔢 Step | ✅ Checkpoint                          | 🔍 What to Look For                                      | 🛠️ Fix/Action                                                 |
|--------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣     | **DNS Points to WAF**                 | `dig` or `nslookup` → does domain point to WAF IP?      | Correct DNS A/CNAME record if not                             |
| 2️⃣     | **WAF Has SSL Certificate Installed** | Is cert + private key uploaded to WAF?                   | Upload valid `.crt` and `.key` files (PEM format)             |
| 3️⃣     | **Cert Matches Domain**               | CN/SAN must match requested domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) | Use matching cert or a wildcard cert                     |
| 4️⃣     | **SSL Protocol/Cipher Support**       | Are secure ciphers and protocols (TLS 1.2/1.3) enabled?  | Avoid SSLv3/TLS 1.0; enable modern TLS and ciphers            |
| 5️⃣     | **Client SSL Profile (F5)**           | Profile must be applied to HTTPS Virtual Server          | Create `client-ssl` profile and attach to VS                  |
| 6️⃣     | **Expired or Self-signed Certs**      | Use `openssl s_client` or browser SSL check              | Renew expired cert; use CA-signed cert in production          |
| 7️⃣     | **Backend Connectivity (WAF → Server)** | Can WAF connect to backend server via HTTP/HTTPS?       | Ping backend IP, check port open, fix routing/firewall        |
| 8️⃣     | **Re-encryption Profile (if bridging)** | For WAF → Web Server HTTPS path                         | Attach `server-ssl` profile (F5) or enable SSL (FortiWeb)     |
| 9️⃣     | **Browser-Specific Errors**           | `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`                      | Mismatch in SAN/CN; use fully qualified domain cert           |
| 🔟     | **Certificate Chain Issues**           | Are intermediate certs missing?                          | Use full chain `.crt` (leaf + intermediates + root)           |
| 1️⃣1️⃣  | **Cloud WAF Proxy Modes**             | Cloudflare Flexible mode breaks HTTPS with origin        | Use **Full (Strict)** mode with valid origin cert             |
| 1️⃣2️⃣  | **Logs & Packet Capture**             | Review WAF logs or use `tcpdump`/Wireshark               | Analyze SSL handshake, cipher negotiation, TCP errors         |
