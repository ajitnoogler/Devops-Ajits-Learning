### How WireGuard Works with NAT

Yes — **WireGuard works very well with NAT**, and that’s one of its strengths compared to older VPN protocols.

---

## **How WireGuard Works with NAT**

* **Transport**: WireGuard runs over **UDP** (default port 51820, configurable).
* **NAT traversal**:

  * Client behind NAT sends the first **Handshake Initiation** to the server’s public IP\:port.
  * The NAT device learns this outbound connection and opens a temporary mapping.
  * Server replies to that mapped IP\:port, and the tunnel is established.
* **No special NAT helpers needed** (unlike some older VPNs like IPSec that needed ESP passthrough).

## **Challenges & Solutions**

| NAT Scenario           | Issue                                                                            | Fix                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client behind NAT**  | Works by default, but mapping may time out if idle.                              | Use `PersistentKeepalive = 25` in client config to send keepalive packets every 25 seconds. |
| **Server behind NAT**  | Not recommended for main server, but can work with port forwarding.              | Configure NAT/router to forward UDP port to server’s internal IP.                           |
| **Double NAT / CGNAT** | May block inbound packets from server to client.                                 | Client must initiate connection; `PersistentKeepalive` keeps mapping alive.                 |
| **Symmetric NAT**      | Each outbound connection uses a different mapping, breaking direct peer-to-peer. | Use a reachable public relay or VPN server with port forwarding.                            |

## **Example: Client Behind NAT**

```
[Client 192.168.1.50:52688] ---> [NAT Router] ---> [Internet] ---> [Server 203.0.113.10:51820]
   (Handshake Initiation)                           (UDP)
<--- (Handshake Response) <------------------------+
<==== Encrypted Tunnel over same NAT mapping ======>
```

* NAT router sees outbound UDP to `203.0.113.10:51820` and allows return packets.
* Keepalives prevent NAT table from expiring.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

* Works out of the box with **home routers, NAT in ISPs, mobile data NAT**.
* **PersistentKeepalive** is your friend for roaming or idle connections.
* If the server is NAT’d, **port forwarding** of UDP is required.

```

What’s Happening Here
- Client sends first packet → creates NAT mapping on client-side router.
- Server replies → passes through server-side NAT because UDP port forwarding is set up.
- Keepalive packets from client prevent NAT mapping from timing out.
- All VPN traffic flows inside this established UDP mapping.

#### NAT Considerations in Both
- Client/Router behind NAT → must initiate handshake.
- Server/Remote Router behind NAT → requires UDP port forwarding.
- PersistentKeepalive (10–25 seconds) prevents idle timeout.
- Symmetric NAT may block direct peer-to-peer; use relay/public IP endpoint.
